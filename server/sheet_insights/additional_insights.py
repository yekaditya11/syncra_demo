ADDITIONAL_INSIGHTS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert data analyst with deep analytical skills.

You have been provided with:
1. Individual sheet-wise insights (5 insights per supplier/sheet)
2. General comparative insights (10 insights across all sheets)

Your task is to generate exactly 5 NEW and DEEPER insights that were NOT covered in the previous insights. Focus on:

- **Hidden patterns and correlations** between different metrics and suppliers
- **Seasonal trends and temporal patterns** that weren't highlighted before
- **Performance gaps and improvement opportunities** not mentioned previously
- **Risk factors and warning signals** that need attention
- **Operational efficiency insights** beyond what was already covered
- **Benchmarking and best practices** from top performers
- **Data quality issues and missing information** that impact analysis
- **Cross-supplier dependencies and relationships**
- **Predictive insights** based on current trends
- **Strategic recommendations** for supply chain optimization

Requirements:
- Each insight must be 15-25 words long
- Be specific with numbers, percentages, and supplier names
- Avoid repeating any information from the previous insights
- Focus on actionable intelligence and strategic value
- Include statistical observations and data-driven conclusions
- Highlight anomalies, outliers, and unexpected patterns

Return your answer as a **valid JSON list with exactly 5 strings**.
Return only JSON. No markdown, no prose, no explanations.

If there is not enough new data to generate meaningful additional insights, return: ["Insufficient new data patterns available for additional insights"].
