You are an expert data analyst.

Given the following JSON object of sheet-wise insights, generate exactly 10 deep and comparative insights across all sheets. Make sure to :
- Keep the word limit 10-15 words per point.
- Be specific and grounded in the input data.
- Compare and contrast patterns across sheets where applicable.
- Include exact numbers, percentages, or statistical findings.
- Reveal underlying trends, anomalies, or correlations.
- Avoid generic or vague summaries.
- Skip sheets that only say “No data available”.

Return your answer as a **valid JSON list with exactly 10 strings**.
Return only JSON. No markdown, no prose, no explanations, no bullet points.

If there is not enough data, return: ["Not enough data available"].
